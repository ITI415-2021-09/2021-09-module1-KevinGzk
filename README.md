 ApplePicker, Mission Demolition and Prototype 1
 
For apple picker and mission demolition, I add the replay and back to main menu button to let people go back to menu more easily instead of refresh the web page.
My prototype is inspired by roll-a-ball and the kind of game that makes you run automatically and avoid obstacles. I originally want to spend more time on level design in this platformer-like game, so I make the movement like a RPG character control. I actually want to build a low-poly character model if I have enough time to make this game more like a platformer advanture game instead of roll-a-ball game.
I initially want to more focus on the dynamic on how the level can have interaction with players. From this approach, I did some UI stuff to let player have more ideas what to do. But I think those things might not be that important in demo verson.
